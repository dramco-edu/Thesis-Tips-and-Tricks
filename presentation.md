# Presentation

- Spend enough time to explain the broader context and the main questions of the work
- Less is more, do not fill your slides with unnecessary text, logos, "fancy" theme-related stuff
- Include numbering on the slides
- A figure is preferable over plain text
- Explain what is on the axes of graphs
- Request a dry-run (on time) to check your presentation before the defense (well on time)
- You can use animations IF they are functional e.g. to focus or zoom in on a specific item.
