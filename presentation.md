# Presentation

- Spend enough time to explain the broader context and the main questions of the work
- Less is more, do not fill your slides with unnecessary text, logos, "fancy" theme-related stuff
- include numbering on the slides
- A figure is preferable over plain text
- Explain what is on the axes of graphs
